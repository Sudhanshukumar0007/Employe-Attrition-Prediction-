# Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (attrition) using logistic regression. The model is built using a dataset from IBM HR Analytics and provides valuable insights into employee behavior.

## üìÅ Dataset

- *Name*: WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv
- *Source*: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset
- *Target Variable*: Attrition (Yes/No)

## üìå Objectives

- Predict employee attrition using logistic regression.
- Perform data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling).
- Visualize feature relationships with attrition.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## üì¶ Libraries Used

- pandas - for data manipulation
- numpy - for numerical operations
- seaborn and matplotlib - for data visualization
- sklearn - for model building and evaluation

Balanced class weights were used to address class imbalance.

üìö Future Work
Try other classification models like Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost.

Perform hyperparameter tuning.

Use SMOTE for handling class imbalance.

Deploy model using Flask/Streamlit.
